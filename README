Ned Speirs's Rumford Soup creator!


About Rumford Soup
------------------
Rumford's Soup (Rumfordsuppe in German) is a cheap, nutritious soup invented
by Count Rumford for the benefit of the poor people in workhouses in Bavaria.
Originally the principal ingredients were barley and yellow peas.  Potatoes
were usually added to save money.  Rumford recommended that it be served over
bread as he thought the physical act of chewing made a soup more satisfying.


About Count Rumford
-------------------
Benjamin Thompson was born in Massachusetts in 1753.  He fled to England
after the Revolutionary War and later moved to Bavaria, where he was made a
count.  He made many early contributions to the science of gunpowder, heat,
and nutrition.


About my soup creator
---------------------
I originally started trying to create a cheap, nutritious soup after reading
about malnutrition in American prisons.  It doesn't make any sense to me that
people should be going hungry in America since food is generally so cheap
here.

While I was developing my soup I found it difficult to juggle all the
different nutrients.  I would add an ingredient to add some nutrient, but then
I would realize that the soup was now deficient in some other nutrient.  The
process of adjusting the soup was very tedious, so I decided to try and write
a program that would do it for me.

I find that I learn about nutrition with my soup.  For instance, I try and eat
more leafy greens since runs of the program so often contain large amounts of
leafy greens.
