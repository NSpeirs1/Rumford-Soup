Amino acid composition
--------
Total protein is in the data, but protein quality isn't considered.  Some 
versions of the soup (especially if one uses a vegan data set) may have 
incomplete protein.

Add tolerable upper intake level of nutrients
--------
to prevent vitamin overdoses, and also to add variety to the soups.

Get better data
--------
Garbage in, garbage out.  Better data is always a good thing (especially data
with variance -- there's always some variation in nutrients, but some of them
probably vary a lot.  This should be taken account of in the soup).

Add price info
--------
Right now the soup would probably be extremely expensive.  If I had some price
data, I could adjust the program to create a true Rumford Soup (cheap and
nutritious)

Make the output more presentable
--------
The output is pretty arcane.  I would like to analyze the output better, and
present it in a more readable format.
